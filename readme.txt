This project is about using human sensor data to predict human gestures.
the data is called the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset. You can check with it from the repo. It includes the pml-training and pml-testing datasets.

For the model, if you are looking for a clearer report, check the pml.html file(compare a decision tree model with random forest model); if you want to check the R code, look the pml.R file (it includes more models).
